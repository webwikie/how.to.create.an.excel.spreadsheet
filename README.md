A spreadsheet is a grid-based file designed to manage or perform any type of calculation on personal or business data. It is accessible in both Office 365 and MS Office. Office 365 is a cloud-based application, whereas MS Office is an on-premises solution. It is the best choice for users because it has 400+ functions and features such as pivot, coloring, graph, chart, and conditional formatting.

The workbook is the Excel lingo for **‘spreadsheet’**. MS Excel uses this term to emphasize that a single workbook can contain multiple worksheets where each one can have its own data grid, chart, or graph.

**Here are a few examples for creating different types of spreadsheets in excel with the key features of the created spreadsheets.**

1. Open MS Excel.
2. Go to Menu and select New >> click on the Blank workbook to create a simple worksheet.
OR – Just press Ctrl + N: To create a new spreadsheet.
3. By default, Sheet1 will be created as a worksheet in the spreadsheet. The name of the spreadsheet will be given as Book1 if you are opening it for the first time.


## Key Features of the Created Spreadsheet:


* **Basic App Functions Area:** There is a green banner which contains all types of actions to perform on the worksheet like – save the file, back or front step move, new, undo, redo and many more.
**Ribbon Area:** This is a grey area just below the basic app functions area and is called Ribbon. It contains data manipulation, data visualizing toolbar, page layout tools, and many more.
* **Spreadsheet Work Area:** By default, a grid contains alphabetic columns like A, B, C, …, Z, ZA…, ZZ, ZZA… and rows as numbers like 1,2 3, …. 100, 101, … so on. Each rectangle box in the spreadsheet is called a cell, like the one selected in the above image (cell A1). It is a cell where the user can perform their calculation for personal or business data.
* **Formula Bar:** It shows the data in the selected cell; if it contains any formula, it will show here. Like the above area, a search bar is available in the top right corner, and a sheet tab is available on the downside of the worksheet. A user can change the name of the sheet name.
